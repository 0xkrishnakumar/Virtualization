# Virtualization

Have you ever wondered how does virtualization work ? How does a virtual machine understand that its running on top of a hypervisor ? How does the drivers work in a vm ? and many other question in that set..

These series of code and README will take you the inner details of virtualization. The code is written in GO and assembly and will bring real hands on understanding of what is going on under the hood. Every code snippet which comes along with this will take you through some salient feature of go and learnings about go. 

I hope you enjoy this ride. I am already having so much of fun :-)

Here are the next stops in our journey to the depths of Virtualization:
